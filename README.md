# Workshop Finder – Landing Page (React + Vite)

This project is a responsive one-page landing site built using React for the frontend and Supabase for backend data storage. It serves as a discovery platform for workshops held across various cities.

🧠 Purpose:
To help users find and join workshops that make weekends creative, spark new hobbies, and turn free time into learning time.

🎨 Workshop Categories:
Artistic, Coding, Communication, Summer Camps, and many more.

⚙️ Core Technologies:
- React: Modular, component-based frontend— ideal for a one-page layout with sections like Hero, Description, WorkshopTypes, and WaitlistForm.
- Supabase: Instant backend with PostgreSQL and RESTful API — ideal for storing waitlist submissions without setting up a full server.
- Tailwind CSS or CSS Modules: For styling and responsiveness


📋Features

- Header, Hero, Description, Workshop Types, Waitlist Form, Footer
- Responsive, mobile-first styling using CSS Modules
- Client-side validation for Name/Email
- Supabase integration to store waitlist submissions in `waitlist` table
- Success and error feedback after form submission


## Getting Started

1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2) Set environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root with:

```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
3) - Initialize Supabase Client
```
// src/lib/supabaseClient.js
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

const supabaseUrl = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL;
const supabaseKey = import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY;

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseKey);
```
4) Create the table in Supabase

Run this SQL in the Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
create table if not exists public.waitlist (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  name text not null,
  email text not null,
  message text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```
⚠️ Challenges Faced with Supabase

When setting up the waitlist table, Supabase enabled Row Level Security (RLS) by default, which caused form submissions to silently fail — no data was being stored.

🧪 Debugging Steps:

- Verified the form logic and Supabase client setup — all correct.
- Checked Supabase logs — no insert errors, but no data appeared.
- Realized RLS was blocking anonymous inserts.

🛠️ Temporary Fix:

- Disabled RLS to test:
alter table public.waitlist disable row level security;

- Submissions started working — but this was not secure.

🔐 Final Secure Setup:

To allow inserts while keeping RLS enabled:

alter table public.waitlist enable row level security;
```
create policy "Allow inserts for anon" on public.waitlist
  for insert
  to anon
  with check (true);

-- Optional: basic RLS setup
alter table public.waitlist enable row level security;
create policy "Allow inserts for anon" on public.waitlist
  for insert
  to anon
  with check (true);
```
This policy allows anonymous users to insert data securely without exposing other rows or operations.

4) Start the dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

🧠 Building with Cursor IDE — My Creative Coding Partner
This entire project was built inside Cursor IDE, and it played a pivotal role in turning my idea into a fully functional, visually appealing landing page. Cursor didn’t just help me write code — it helped me think, structure, and solve problems faster.

✨ Prompt That Sparked It All
To generate the initial structure, I used this prompt in Cursor:
```
Build a responsive one-page landing site using React, styled with CSS modules or Tailwind. The site is for a platform that helps users discover and join workshops across different cities — including artistic, coding, communication, summer camps, and more.

🔹 Structure:
- Header with logo and navigation
- Hero section with a short tagline like “Discover Workshops That Inspire You”
- Product description explaining how users can browse workshops by category and city
- Visual section with icons or images representing different workshop types
- Waitlist form with fields: Name, Email, Message/Interest
- Footer with social links and contact info

🔹 Tech Stack:
- React (functional components)
- Supabase for backend (store waitlist form submissions)
- Use `@supabase/supabase-js` via CDN or npm
- Form should validate inputs and insert data into Supabase `waitlist` table with fields: name, email, message

🔹 Bonus:
- Add basic success/error feedback after form submission
- Use modular components: Header.jsx, Hero.jsx, Description.jsx, WorkshopTypes.jsx, WaitlistForm.jsx, Footer.jsx
- Keep styling clean and mobile-friendly
```
Cursor interpreted this prompt beautifully — generating a clean, modular React structure with all the components I envisioned.


🎨 Frontend Experience
The frontend generated by Cursor was surprisingly polished:
- It clearly explained where to insert my Supabase URL and anon key
- It scaffolded all the components with functional React syntax
- It included form validation logic and Supabase insert calls
- The color palette it chose was modern and pleasing — soft gradients, rounded corners, and spacing that matched current UI trends
- The layout was mobile-friendly by default, with responsive flex/grid styling
This saved me hours of manual setup and design tweaking.

🔗 Supabase Integration Support
Cursor also guided me through Supabase setup:
- It showed how to create the waitlist table
- It explained how to use environment variables with Vite
- It helped me debug the Row Level Security (RLS) issue:
- When data wasn’t storing, Cursor suggested checking RLS
- It helped me write the correct SQL policy to allow anonymous inserts securely
This was a turning point — I learned how Supabase protects data and how to configure it properly.


💬 Final Thoughts
Cursor IDE didn’t just help me code — it helped me create. It understood my vision, scaffolded the right structure, and supported me through every technical challenge. The result was a branded, responsive landing page that feels modern, intuitive, and ready to grow.


## File Structure

- `index.html` – Vite entry HTML
- `src/main.jsx` – App bootstrap
- `src/App.jsx` – Page composition
- `src/lib/supabaseClient.js` – Supabase client from env
- `src/components/*` – Modular React components + CSS modules
- `src/styles/global.css` – Global tokens and base styles

⚡ What I Learned About Building Fast with “Vibe Coding” Tools
“Vibe coding” is about staying in flow — building fast, iterating freely, and letting creativity guide the structure. This project taught me how powerful that mindset can be when paired with the right tools.
🧠 Staying in Flow with Cursor IDE
- Cursor let me skip boilerplate and jump straight into building.
- I could describe my idea in natural language, and it generated modular React components that matched my vision.
- It explained where to plug in my Supabase keys, how to structure the form, and even how to write SQL policies when I hit backend issues.
🚀 Supabase for Instant Backend
- Supabase gave me a ready-to-use database with RESTful APIs and RLS security.
- I didn’t need to set up servers or write backend logic — just connect and go.
- It was perfect for storing waitlist submissions securely and scaling later if needed.
🤖 AI Tools as Creative Partners
- Cursor and Copilot weren’t just assistants — they were collaborators.
- They helped me debug, refactor, and even style the UI with trendy color palettes and responsive layouts.
- I learned how to ask better prompts to get exactly what I needed — from component scaffolding to SQL fixes.
🧩 Modular Thinking
- Vibe coding encouraged me to break the UI into clean, reusable components.
- I didn’t overthink architecture — I built what felt right, then refined it.
- This made the project easy to maintain and extend.
🎨 Design Without Distraction
- The auto-generated styles were visually pleasing and modern — I didn’t waste time tweaking colors or spacing.
- Tailwind and CSS modules gave me flexibility without complexity.

💡 Final Takeaway
Vibe coding tools helped me build fast, learn deeply, and stay creative. I wasn’t just writing code — I was shaping an experience. And with tools like Cursor IDE and Supabase, I could go from idea to working product in hours, not days.



## Notes

- The waitlist form inserts `{ name, email, message }` into `public.waitlist`.
- If you use different table/columns, update `src/components/WaitlistForm.jsx` accordingly.
- For production, rotate your anon key as needed and harden RLS policies.
